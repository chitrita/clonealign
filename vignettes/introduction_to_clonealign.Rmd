# Overview

`clonealign` assigns cells measured using single-cell RNA-seq to their clones of origin using copy number data. This is especially useful when clones are inferred from shallow single-cell DNA-seq, in which case the copy number state of each clone is known, but the precise SNV structure is unknown.

To assign cells to clones, `clonealign` makes the assumption that

$$ \text{gene expression} \propto \text{number of gene copies} $$

This is demonstrated in the figure below.

Mathematically we have an $N \times G$ matrix $Y$ of raw gene expression counts (from RNA-seq) for $N$ cells and $G$ genes, where $y_{ng}$ is the counts to gene $g$ in cell $c$. We also have a $G \times C$ matrix $\Lambda$ of copy number variation for $C$ clones, where $\lambda_{gc}$ is the copy number of gene $g$ in clone $c$. We introduce a clone-assigning categorical variable $\pi_n$ for each cell, where

$$ \pi_n = c \text{ if cell $n$ on clone $c$} $$

then `clonealign` models the conditional expected counts in a gene and cell as

$$ E[y_{ng} | \pi_n] = \frac{\lambda_{g,\pi_n}}{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{g'} \lambda_{g,\pi_n}} s_n \mu_g $$

where $s_n$ is a cell-specific size factor (calculated by default by `scran::computeSumFactors`) and $\mu_g$ is the "base" expression in an idealised monozygotic setting. The noise distribution is assumed to be negative-binomial. Inference is performed using expectation-maximization to find maximum likelihood estimates of the clone assignments $\pi_n$ and of all other model parameters.
 
# Basic usage

## Data preparation

By default, `clonealign` requires two inputs:

* Gene expression data as raw counts. This can be in the form of a `SingleCellExperiment`, `SummarizedExperiment` or **cell by gene** `matrix`
* Copy number profiles for each clone and gene (where the genes **must** be the same as those measured in the expression data). This can be in the form of a `data.frame`, `DataFrame` or `matrix`

Bundled with the package is an example `SingleCellExperiment` for 100 genes and 200 cells:

```{r}
library(clonealign)
data(example_sce)
example_sce
```

This has raw integer counts in the `assays` slot as required for input to `clonealign`:

```{r}
assay(example_sce, "counts")[1:5, 1:5]
```


The CNV data is stored in the `rowData` of the `SingleCellExperiment` for 3 clones (A, B, and C) and crucially the same genes as the expression data:

```{r}
cnv_data <- rowData(example_sce)[, c("A", "B", "C")]
stopifnot(nrow(cnv_data) == nrow(example_sce)) # Make sure genes match up
head(cnv_data)
```



## Model fitting

The model is fitted with a basic call to `clonealign`, which prints the (relative change in) log-likelihood for each iteration (this can be turned off by setting `verbose = FALSE`):

```{r}
cal <- clonealign(example_sce, cnv_data)
```

```{r}
print(cal)
```


The maximum likelihood estimates of the clone assignments can be access through the `clone` slot:

```{r}
clones <- cal$clone
table(clones)
```

This can easily be added to the `SingleCellExperiment` for visualization with `scater`:

```{r}
library(scater)
example_sce$clone <- clones
example_sce <- normaliseExprs(example_sce)
plotPCA(example_sce, ncomponents = 3, colour_by = "clone")
```

The clone assignments in `clones` can then be used for the desired downstream analysis, such as differential expression or SNV analysis.
